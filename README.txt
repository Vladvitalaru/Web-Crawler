The script is ran using command: python3 webcrawler.py


A prompt will ask for a url input by the user followed by how many pages to scrape in the terminal.

Paste a link to an HTML site as the starting seed.


Ex: https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_from_Tarkov_Wiki


The program will begin scraping through the url, downloading page text content to a "Data" folder at the path where the script was ran from. It will also create a json at the script's path, storing an adjacency matrix of links.


Please refer to Latex Writeup for further details on implementation.
